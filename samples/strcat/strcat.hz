module string_concat


let hello : string => "hello "
let world : string => "world "

let hello_world : string => hello ++ world


(*

    main doesnt have to return an integer but this trick is out of the lack of type checking i have for hazel right now
    to do things like this you would have to use a monad most likely

let main : string => hello_world
